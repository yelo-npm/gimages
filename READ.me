Attempt at an automated google image downlader
doesn't work, because, a) no options to choose from (size, etc), and b) I don't like the API

# install
clone repo, npm install, and add ./bin to your path

# usage

gimages foxes --> will download 10 images of foxes in the current dir

gimages 20 foxes --> will download 20 images of foxes in the current dir

gimages 20 fire foxes ./images/ --> will download 20 images of fire+foxes in ./images

note: the "/" at the end of the dir is mandatory, or else it will be considered a search result

You are limited by google to 100 requests per day
